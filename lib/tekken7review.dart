Luckily the game knows how to get maximum gain out of seemingly minimal additions, like the flashy Rage Arts, tactical Power Crushes and surprisingly spectacular presence of Street Fighter icon Akuma.

It strikes a fine balance between accessibility to series newcomers and retaining much of its technical traditions. The soundtrack is an electronic treat, and while the story can at times seem a bit cliche, the fact that it never takes itself too seriously lets it bring in a tremendous amount of flexible character customization. Its dedication to the details helps push it into the position of my favorite fighting game of 2017 so far.",
